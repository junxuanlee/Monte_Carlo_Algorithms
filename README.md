# Monte_Carlo_Algorithms
The algorithms experimented in this repository are:

i) Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS)

ii) Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR), also known as Particle Filter

Both algorithms were implemented on 2nd order dynamic autoregressive (AR) problem to observe their performance.
