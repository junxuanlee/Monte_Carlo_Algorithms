# Monte_Carlo_Algorithms
The algorithms experimented in this repository are:

i) Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS)

ii) Sequential Importance Resampling (SIR), also known as Particle Filter

The performance of both algorithms were compared with Kalman Filter (KF) on 2nd order dynamic autoregressive (AR) problem.
