# Monte_Carlo_Algorithms

The implementations in this repository involve:

i) KF, SIS and SIR on autoregressive problem

ii) EKF, SIS and SIR on logistic regression problem

KF: Kalman Filter, EKF: Extended Kalman Filter, SIS: Sequential Importance Sampling, SIR: Sequential Importance Resampling (also known as Particle Filter)
